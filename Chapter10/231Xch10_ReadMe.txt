The code samples for this chapter are presented in the same form and order as found in the book. 
  
The reader is reminded that these samples are mostly sections of HTML and CSS code, not finalized web pages themselves. Also, where HTML and CSS code samples illustrate the same example, they are contained in the same txt file.
